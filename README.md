# Edtech-website

Over the past few years, videos are being widely used in classrooms for helping students to learn the material faster than ever. Learning the subject by using the videos is quite effective rather than teaching students through traditional text-books. Making students understand the subject through the videos is known as “e-learning”.
Hence our project is to create such animated videos and post them on our educational website. Videos create a more engaging experience than the materials or books. Videos simplify learning. Website is designed in a creative and innovative way provided with animation videos. We try to design the website in a way that students enjoy learning the courses, gain knowledge and develop their skills.
